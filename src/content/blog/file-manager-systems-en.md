## Intro

As living beings to obtain information, we make use of data and we store them in our mind, that is to say, we organize the data in our database (the mind) and we mold them internally, that is to say, we shape the interior or in other words, we in-form ourselves to learn and obtain knowledge.
When it comes to classifying information we do the same whether in a physical environment with a folio or a digital one with an electronic device. In a physical environment to classify information we write in notebooks, notepads, blackboards; while in a digital environment we need tools that adapt.

To digitally organize the information that abounds and sometimes exceeds, it is essential to follow a good method of categorization or workflow and have the necessary tools to facilitate the process. In this way we will achieve an orderly system that is easier to consult and study, even for people who know the subject.

The categorization method is a personal matter, but the software used is universal for everyone. This type of software focused on file organization is called **managers**. Depending on the use there are several types, in this article we will mention the most relevant ones.

## Backup manager

Backup managers are essential to keep files synchronized between devices and storage sources. In order to avoid file loss and keep devices up to date.

- [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org/). One of the best folder comparison and synchronization software (cross-platform, open-source and free) for creating and managing file backups.
- [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/). A backup client that securely stores encrypted, incremental and compressed backups on local storage, cloud storage services and remote file servers.
- [RClone](https://rclone.org/). Like rsync but in the cloud, it is a command-line program for synchronizing files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers.
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). Open, reliable and decentralized app. Data is stored privately in a selectable storage location.
- [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250). A popular Mac app that allows you to back up and roll back in time to that state of the machine.

Files can also be synchronized via terminal commands:

- [robocopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy). This is a Windows command that allows backups to be made between two directory paths.
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/). An open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer, it is completely free to download.
- cp. Linux command for copy files and directories.
  ´cp [OPTION] filename destinationDirectory´. [Option]=-f,-h,-i,-n,-p,-r, --backup.

## File manager

File managers are the oldest and best known software for organizing all types of files, they are usually general viewers and file metadata editors. They are not usually compatible with the files since they require players, editors, etc. They are usually in a graphical environment or in their simplest form file listings in the command terminal.

## The "ideal" manager

The perfect manager app should have the following features:

1. License: open source (to be transparent against data usage).
2. Cost: free (with donation) or one-time payment for life (maximum price 80 €).
3. Compatibility: multiplatform (Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android).
4. Privacy: private local app (no data sent to third parties).
5. Interface: simple with a variety of themes (light and dark).
6. Classification system: hierarchical structure with folders and directory path.
7. General classification:
	1. Storage that preserves the directory structure.
	2. File labeling, punctuation, addition of metadata.
	3. File filtering by type or metadata.
	4. Saving of web pages (with offline reading option).
	5. Display of files with different views (details, icons, list, thumbnail).
	6. Sorting by file metadata (name, creation date, tag...).
	7. Advanced search panel.
	8. Current directory path panel.
	9. Graphical viewers: tree structure and graph viewer.
8. Supported file formats.
	1. Playable formats:
		- Audio (aac, aiff, dsd, flac, mp3, wav, wma).
		- Documents (csv, docx, epub, html, md, pdf, txt, xml).
		- Image (bmp, gif, jpg, png, psd, raw, svg, tiff, web).
		- Video (avi, divx, flv, mp4, mov, mkv, webm).
	2. Editable formats (optional):
		- Audio. Speed, trim and pitch editing.
		- Documents. Plain text editing.
		- Image. Contrast, brightness, saturation, shadows and color editing.
		- Videos. Editing of audio + image values.

- The "ideal" manager would be a mix of:
   	- Eagle.cool for the file display, interface and group tagging.
   	- Windows Explorer or Files for its filtering and organization options.
   	- Obsdian.md for its graph viewer, customizable interface and compatible plugins.
   	- TagSpaces for its geotagging, allowing to keep the folder structure.

My favorite to date is Eagle.cool but the problem is that it does not allow to open all files internally (although for that there are editors) and its storage is in a library of the program itself with a folder per file with (name.xyz + name_minuature.xyz + name.json) which makes the file transfer much slower by the number of folders created. Another point against it is that it only allows two devices with Windows or Mac registry.
Another very useful manager is Files, the modern and open-source version of the well-known Windows explorer, with color labeling, multi-window and a variety of themes. The bad thing is that it is only for Windows, the view of folders is hierarchical and the labeling is basic without grouping or the possibility of exporting.

As a fact to add metadata to the files an external database is needed, since normally the files according to the format come with their own metadata limit. This makes it necessary to add files with extra information (info-extra.json) and the folder structure changes. One way to preserve the directory structure is to add the metadata in the file name but this is a limited method.

## Conclusion

The software used to manage files is a good tool to classify information and facilitate the work of collecting and learning. But at the end of the day what matters is the objective you want to achieve with these data, you can vary the method until you find the one you like the most or the one you are most comfortable with.
